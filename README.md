# waywe

### Dynamic wallpaper on wayland, based on wallpaper engine and mpvpaper

# Why

It's frustrating that wallpaper engine doesn't support linux. So I write this simple script to load videos from wallpaper engine and play it with [mpvpaper](https://github.com/GhostNaN/mpvpaper).

# Usage

```
Usage: waywe [options] [command]

Options:
  -h, --help       display help for command

Commands:
  start [options]  start waywe
  send <command>
  attach           attach to mpv interactive control
  stop
  unpause
  pause
  next
  preview
  help [command]   display help for command

```
